"""
Reachy Mini Central - WebRTC Signaling Server

This server implements the GStreamer WebRTC signaling protocol using:
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) for server-to-client messages
- HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

This works reliably through HTTP/2 proxies like HuggingFace Spaces.

Lifecycle responsibilities (see ``reachy_mini/docs/SIGNALING.md`` for the
canonical contract):

- Forward producer ``meta`` verbatim to listeners (no re-interpretation).
- Track ``last_seen`` per peer; evict peers whose lease has expired.
- Honour ``setPeerStatus(roles=[])`` by removing the peer from
  ``producers`` immediately (the SSE channel stays open so the daemon
  can re-register without reconnecting).
- Detect ``install_id`` collisions inside a single user's fleet and
  evict the older producer (last-writer-wins) so a re-flashed daemon
  never coexists with its own ghost.

# --- Liveness (TTL / lease) settings ---------------------------------
#
# A peer is considered alive while it keeps its SSE channel open AND
# its last application-level activity (POST /send or SSE message
# delivery) is younger than ``LEASE_SECONDS``. The sweeper task scans
# every ``SWEEPER_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` and evicts any expired peer.
#
# Sizing: ``LEASE_SECONDS`` MUST be at least ``2.5 *
# RECOMMENDED_HEARTBEAT`` so a healthy daemon tolerates 2 consecutive
# missed heartbeats (network blip, transient relay restart) without
# false eviction. The daemon negotiates its actual heartbeat interval
# from this lease via the ``welcome`` SSE message (see
# ``recommended_heartbeat_interval_seconds`` below), so the only
# parameter we need to keep stable is the lease itself.
#
# This Space (tfrere/reachy_mini_central) has ``sleep_time=None`` and
# ``gcTimeout=48h``, so cold-start latency is not a concern; we can
# size the lease tightly to minimise the staleness window observed by
# remote clients (mobile/desktop too far for BLE).
#
# 30 s default: heartbeat = lease / 3 = 10 s, which sits comfortably
# below the 60 s idle timeout typical of HTTP/2 proxies (HF Spaces,
# Cloudflare). This applies the WebSocket "75 % rule" (heartbeat at
# 75 % of the shortest proxy timeout) while halving baseline relay
# traffic vs the previous 5 s cadence. Tunable via env var for local
# testing of failure paths without a code change.

#    daemons (USB + Wi-Fi + extras). Keying the bucket on ``username``
#    makes them cannibalise each other, so adding a robot to the fleet
#    silently throttles the others. Hashing the token gives every peer
#    its own quota - the multi-tenant SaaS pattern of "composite key
#    per session" applied to robots.
#
# 2. **Sliding window via deque, not fixed 60 s window.** Fixed windows
#    rebound abruptly at the boundary (a peer that hit 100/100 at
#    t=59.9 s instantly gets 100 fresh tokens at t=60.0 s, encouraging
#    bursty clients). A deque of monotonic timestamps drops entries as
#    they age out, which is smoother and preserves the per-second
#    average regardless of clock alignment.
#
# Sizing: 1200 req / 60 s = 20 req/s sustained per peer, aligned with
# typical WebRTC signaling servers (CloudGaming reports 200 msg / 10 s
# per connection). With heartbeat at 10 s (6 req/min), a typical mobile
# session (offer + answer + ~10 ICE candidates ~ 15 req over a few
# seconds), and aggressive reconnects, observed peak under load is
# ~50-100 req/min/peer. We keep a 12-24x headroom so adding features

    ``meta`` mirrors the producer metadata as registered via ``setPeerStatus``
    (same shape as the SSE ``list`` message). It carries ``install_id`` -
    the stable per-install key that mobile/desktop clients use to dedupe a
    central listing against the same physical robot's BLE / loopback row.
    Forwarded verbatim so future daemon-side fields (capabilities, version,
    ...) appear without another central change.

    ``last_seen_age_seconds`` is the wall-time gap since the producer last
    sent inbound traffic (POST /send heartbeat). Clients can gate their UI
    "reachable" state on ``age < lease_seconds * 0.6`` for a tighter
    freshness check than the server-side sweeper window. ``lease_seconds``
    is mirrored at the top level so clients don't need to query
    ``/health`` separately.
